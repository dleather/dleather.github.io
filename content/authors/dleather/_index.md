    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a quantitative researcher who studies real estate markets.

I have a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I specalized in empirical macroeconomics and finance.

I'm currently an Assistant Professor of Real Estate and Finance at Chapman University's Argyros College of Business and Economics. I teach courses in Macroeconomics and Real Estate Economics to undergraduate and graduate business school students.  

Recently I have investigated student housing markets in the United States, and the impact of height regulations on the supply of residential real estate in New York City.
